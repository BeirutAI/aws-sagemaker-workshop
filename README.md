## Creating a Notebook Instance
SageMaker provides hosted Jupyter notebooks that require no setup, so you can begin processing your training data sets immediately. With a few clicks in the SageMaker console, you can create a fully managed notebook instance, pre-loaded with useful libraries for machine learning. You need only add your data.

To create a SageMaker notebook instance for this workshop, follow the instructions at[**Creating a Notebook Instance**](NotebookCreation), then return here to continue with the next module of the workshop.
